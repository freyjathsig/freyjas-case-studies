## Introduction
This repository contains my case study project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. As a beginner in data analytics and R programming, I have documented my learning process and findings in this project.

The analysis is performed using RStudio, with a focus on packages within the `tidyverse` suite, `lubridate` for date manipulation, and `janitor` for data cleaning.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is the *Comprehensive Credit Card Transactions Dataset*, which is publicly available and was uploaded by Rajatsurana979 to Kaggle. It includes credit card transaction records from January 2023 to October 2023.

You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajatsurana979/comprehensive-credit-card-transactions-dataset/data).

## Project Structure
The project follows the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. Each step is documented in the R Markdown file, with corresponding R code and explanations.

- **ASK & PREPARE**: Initial exploration of the dataset and preparation for analysis.
- **ANALYZE & SHARE**: Descriptive statistics, data visualization, and inferential statistics to uncover insights.
- **Business Strategy**: Recommendations based on the analysis.
- **Limitation and Further Studies**: Discussion of the dataset's limitations and potential future work.
